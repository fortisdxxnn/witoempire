                <p>Its spread has left national economies and businesses counting the costs, as governments struggle with new lockdown measures to tackle the spread of the virus. A difficult year for job seekers Many people have lost their jobs or seen their
                    incomes cut. Unemployment rates have increased across major economies. Here are 3 ways to shop safely during the COVID-19 outbreak: <br> 1. Wear a mask - wear a mask or cover your mouth and nose with a cloth when in the supermarket
                    when social distancing is not easy to maintain. <br>2. Sanitize before entry - Use hand sanitizer as soon as you are in the supermarket.<br> Sanitize before entry to cut down on inadvertently spreading germs to others.<br> 3. Keep
                    your distance - Keep your 6-foot distance as best as you can in aisles and at the register. Be mindful of other shoppers and try to take what you touch when picking out groceries. How did W.I.T.O’s Empire adjusted to the change from
                    COVID? - online ordering: To handle the surge of orders, largely for curbside pickup, W.I.T.O’s Empire have made drastic changes, including dedicating sections of our parking lots for order pickup to strictly fulfill online orders
                    and don’t allow customers inside. Instead of unrelated items placed far apart in a physical store, W.I.T.O’s Empire connects the items on the ordering app. - Focus On Speed, Convenience And Safety Instead of strolling the aisles to
                    choose their groceries, shoppers are now focused on getting in and out as quickly and conveniently as possible. Over the last six months, consumers have decreased the amount of time they spend in stores. To match the changing trends,
                    W.IT.O’s Empire focuses mainly on restocking our best-selling shelf-stable items instead of branching out with new brands and products.</p>
